This Project will create a website to attract potential and existing bridge players to sign up a to a bridge club called CBBridge

UX
The User visiting this page would be a person wanting to learn bridge, or an existing bridge player looking for somewhere to play bridge. On visiting the site they should be able to 
(i)	Understand content/layout of webpage from index page
(ii)	Navigate to find out information about Bridge in general
(iii)	Navigate to Bridge classes information and from there sign up for classes
(iv)	Navigate to information on Bridge play and sign up to play from there
(v)	Navigate to the Contact form and send information from there
(vi)	Return to start of page from all sections


Strategy 
The website is designed for a bridge club that wants to create an online presence to attract students and players to sign up to their club for lessons or to play. 
It is aimed at people who are thinking about starting the game of bridge and at people who can play bridge and are looking for a place to play. 
A search of existing Bridge club websites shows there are very many bridge clubs with websites, but the vast majority are created with a generic template from an organisation called ‘Bridgewebs.com’. This provides a simple and easy way to create a webpage from a generic template which is tailored to the needs of most bridge clubs but has resulted in an overwhelming sameness of the sites and this bridge club wanted to create something different.
Online brainstorming sessions were undertaken with 2 groups of people. One who do not play bridge, and one who do. These sessions resulted in 3 broad categories of information that it was felt would be helpful towards the development of the website.






Barriers that prevent people starting bridge include;
1.	Demographics (Most people think all Bridge players are old!)
2.	Bridge is perceived as dull or boring
3.	Bridge is perceived as being complicated and difficult to learn
4.	Bridge is perceived as taking a long time to learn
5.	There is a fear of failure
6.	There is a lack of awareness about Bridge








The reasons motivating people to take up Bridge include;
1.	Social activity with friends/family
2.	Mental Stimulation
3.	Lifelong hobby












The reasons why people who play bridge love it include;
1.	It is intellectually stimulating
2.	It is mentally absorbing 
3.	It is social
4.	It is fun
5.	It is a life-long hobby  
6.	It is a cheap pastime
7.	It is easily accessible





It was obvious from this research that, as well as providing information about bridge classes and play, the website would need to address the barriers to taking up bridge and emphasize the positive aspects of learning and playing bridge.
The website would need to; 
1.	Explain what bridge entails and try to address some of the barriers to taking up bridge 
2.	Highlight the positive aspects of bridge (intellectual, mental, social, fun, life-long, cheap and accessible)  
3.	Encourage beginners to start lessons by focussing on the factors that motivate people to start bridge
4.	Encourage players to play with us by emphasising the positive aspects of the club and additional dimensions of the club (events, online activities).
5.	Provide visitors with a means of signing up on the website.
6.	Provide interactive activities to retain interest.

 

The websites opportunities to meet these needs were listed with the associated feasibility of achieving these for an initial release.

These were plotted to help decide which are best included in the initial release.

 

From this assessment it seems obvious that the features to be included in the first release should include 

1.	Creating an online presence
2.	Addressing barriers to starting bridge
3.	Provide information on lessons/play
4.	Provide opportunity to recruit students and players

Objective Requirements;  	The user will want to enrol in Bridge classes or Bridge play.
Functional requirements; 	To achieve this the website will provide them with relevant information that takes into account the research findings and the site will include the ability to sign up to the club from website. 
Non functional requirements; 	The level of interactivity and complexity of the site will be limited by both the skill set of the person compiling the website and the likelihood that a significant proportion of people seeking bridge classes/play may be mature and may not have the technological skills of a younger demographic.
Business rule requirements; The site will conform to data protection regulations

Structure
It is anticipated that the quantity of information on this website will be not be extensive the demographic coming to the site might not be very technologically advanced and so a single page linear structure should suffice. Users will be a given a navigation bar at the start and a return to home button as the page scrolls down. The contact/submission form will collect minimal information and have dropdown menus to help people include their ability level and buttons to select if they are interested in classes, play or both. 

Skeleton 
The page will start with a navigation bar followed by a simple hero image with immediate links to classes and play. This will be followed by a section about bridge in general which is aimed at addressing some of the barriers people have to starting Bridge. This will be followed by a section giving details about classes with an option to sign-up, and then a similar section for play. Finally, there will be a contact form for additional queries and a footer with information, social media links and a map. These are laid out in the Balsamiq wireframe below.
The site will have a modal addressing the adaption of the club during COVID-19 restrictions.

Future features;
Future features that could be added to the website include design options beyond difficulties implementing would be those identified in the Strategy Plane but were not feasible in this release and design items that need increased technical ability.
That is 
1.Provision of an online discussion forum for bridge problems.
2. Providing interactive bridge hands and quizzes
3. Integrating the website with existing online bridge platforms e.g. Bridge Base Online and RealBridge
4. Wanted to make the about bridge sections to contain more text and end with ellipsis and ‘Read More’ option but did not have technical ability and would add

Deployment.
The project was deployed using GitHub. The code, written in Gitpod, was pushed to GitHub. From the settings tab of my repository in GitHub by scrolling to ‘GutHUb Pages’ and  selecting tand saving he master branch GItHub  created the page 
https://conacbreslin.github.io/CBBridge/

on my repository then navigating to "Github pages" Changing the source from none to master, this then deployed a link that can be found here : https://nemixu.github.io/Milestone1/
