                    <h3>What is Bridge?</h3>
                    <p>Bridge is a card game. It involves players playing in pairs against each other to try and win
                        up to 13 tricks in each round. All 52 cards in the pack are dealt out and each player get 13
                        cards. There are then several stages to the game. The first is called the ‘auction’ and involves
                        the pairs trying to work out how many of the 13 tricks they think they can win (without seeing
                        each others cards). After the auction is over the pair who won the auction (by making the highest
                        bid) play the hand and when the play is over the pair is awarded a score that reflects how
                        close they came to the number bid they made in the auction. Click here to find a link to a website
                        that describes the game in more detail. <span><a class="btn btn-sm btn-dark" href="#">Read More</a></span>

                    <h3>Why play Bridge?</h3>

                    <p>Bridge is a fascinating game that people who play it never tire of. Why is that? There are
                        many reasons. Every time you play it is different. There are over 750 trillion possible
                        combinations of bridge hands so it’s unlikely you’ll ever meet the same hand twice. Each hand only lasts
                        5-10 minutes so it’s always changing. Bridge has been shown to exercise your brain – stimulating
                        both sides! It is a unique type of mental activity that can both calm you down and fire you up at
                        the same time. It is a pastime that can last you a lifetime. It is social. It can be played with
                        as few as four people but, in any of the hundreds of clubs around the county, you can play with
                        any number of people. It is cheap – all you need to play at home is a pack of cards and three
                        friends, or a computer. Even in a club it rarely costs more than a few euro to play all
                        evening. It is played all over the country and all over the world.<span><a class="btn btn-sm btn-dark"

                    <h3>Is Bridge difficult?</h3>

                    <p>Many people think that bridge it difficult to learn, however as long as you can count to
                        13 you can learn bridge, and if you can count to 40 then you’re already on your way. How easy
                        or hard you find it can depend on a number of factors. If you have experience of other card
                        games you might find that helps. Choosing to learn in a fun and social environment with a
                        qualified teacher also helps. If you have a friend or family member you can learn with then that
                        is always a great support however, it is not essential to learn with a partner, indeed very many
                        people make great friendships through finding bridge partners. Bridge cannot be absorbed, it
                        has to be actively learned so if you can and devote a little time to it between classes your
                        progress will be faster and easier as you build your knowledge.<span><a class="btn btn-sm btn-dark"

                    <h3>Does Bridge take long to learn?</h3>
                    <p>In the past Bridge did take time to learn, however now we begin with simplified versions
                        of the game, like Minibridge and Abridged, and it is possible to start playing hands of bridge
                        after only one lesson! Once you get started it takes at least two terms of lessons before you
                        would be ready to play in a club. After that it is entirely up to you how much more you want to
                        learn. Some people never take any more classes after they have mastered the basics. Most people
                        start playing after they have learned the basics and then return to lessons intermittently
                        when they feel they are ready and want to expand their knowledge. Most advanced players have
                        returned to lessons several times throughout their bridge life.<span><a class="btn btn-sm btn-dark"
